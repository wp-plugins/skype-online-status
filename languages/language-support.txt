
== Skype Online Status supports WP localization ==

(1) IF your WP_LANG variable is set correctly (wp-config.php) and IF there is a translation file (.mo) in your 
    wp-content/plugins/skype-online-status/language folder, the translation should be picked up immediately.

(2) IF there is no translation in your language, please consider making one. A rough guide can be found below.

(3) When you are satisfied with your translation, please be so kind to share it with the rest of the world 
    and send it to ravanhagen@gmail.com for inclusion on http://extend.wordpress.org/plugins/skype-online-status


= Note =

If you have suggestions or corrections, please get in touch with the actual author
of the translation file (see the list in readme.txt).

If you would like to contribute a new language file, send me an email: 
ravanhagen@gmail.com


== Rough Translation Guide ==

This step-by-step takes French (France) as an example language/locale: fr_FR
Please adapt for your language the language and country code.

(1) Download poEdit from http://www.poedit.org/download.php and install it.

(2) Launch poEdit.

(3) Go To 'File -> New catalog from POT file'

(4) Browse for the file 'skype-online-status.pot' in ./skype-online-status/languages/ and click 'Open'.

(5) Fill in the following details to the settings:

        * Project name and version: Skype Online Status x.x.x
        * Team: Fill in your own name
        * Team's email address: Fill in your own email address
        * Language: French
        * Country: FRANCE
        * Charset: utf-8
        * Source code charset: Leave it blank
        * Pural Forms: Leave it blank

    Click 'Ok'.
    Save it as 'skype-online-status-fr_FR.po' in ./skype-online-status/languages/

(6) Type in the translated string in the small box located at the bottom left hand corner of the screen.
    Translate the remaining strings.

(7) When you are all done, click on the 'Save Catalog' button located on the top, it is the second button
    from the left.

(8) Open in a simple text editor (like Notepad or gedit) the file 'en.js', translate the texts there, keeping
    the code as it is. Now do Save as... 'fr.js'

Now to test your translation file:

(9) Upload the new 'skype-online-status-fr_FR.po' and 'skype-online-status-fr_FR.mo' files to your site into
    wp-contents/plugins/skype-online-status/languages/
    Just a note, the .mo is automatically generated by poEdit, you NEED the file in order for the translation
    to work.

(10) Make sure that your WordPress is using the same language/locale fr_FR (WP_LANG variable in wp-config.php)
    or the plugin translation will not work.

Final step:

(11) Send me the files you created during this process and you will be mentioned in the documentation as 
     contributor :) 

Thanks!
