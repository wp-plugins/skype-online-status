Unlimited, highly customizable and accessible (!) Skype buttons through widgets, post shortcode/quicktag and template tags.

== Description ==

NOTICE: as of Mai 2015, Microsoft has officially dropped Skype's Online Status service [read more](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA605/how-do-i-set-up-the-skype-button-to-show-my-status-on-the-web-in-skype-for-windows-desktop) and consequently, this plugin will no longer be able to provide buttons that indicate online status. Only legacy Skype buttons that do _not_ reflect the users online status remain available.

This WordPress plugin allows you to add one or multiple, customizable and accessible (!) Skype buttons to your site. You can pick any of the (still) available legacy Skype button themes and place them in your *pages and posts content* (with a neat little Skype button in the WYSIWYG editor), in your sidebar via *widgets* (unlimited number) or anywhere in your theme template files.

The Skype Buttons admin page and Skype Widget options are adequately annotated but there is also a **Quick Guide** section with lots of information on all the possible ways to get you blog Skyped. If you still cannot get it working the way you want to, find a Skype link to the developer on the Notes & Live Support section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my Skype Online Status button not working anymore? =

As of Mai 15th, 2015, Microsoft has officially dropped Skype's Online Status service. Consequently, all online status buttons stopped working but legacy Skype buttons that do not reflect the users online status are still available.

Go to your Settings > Skype Buttons (or Appearance > Widgets) and switch to any of the available preset themes to get a working Skype Button back.

= I have found a bug. Where do I report it? =

For bug reports, go to [WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status http://wordpress.org/tags/skype-online-status "WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status") and describe what is happening there. Please provide as much related info as you can but at least give me your plugin and Wordpress version number.

= I have a feature request. Where do I ask? =

For all 'normal' feature requests and suggestions go to [WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status http://wordpress.org/tags/skype-online-status "WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status") but if you want custom development, please contact me directly from the *Notes & Live Support* section on the Skype Online Status options page or browse to my website [Status301 http://status301.net/ "Status301.net"). I will gladly consider any proposal.

= I have trouble setting up a Skype button on my blog. Where do I get help? =

Have you read the *Quick Guide* section of your WordPress Options > Skype Status page, available after installation already? For all remaining questions, post them on [WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status http://wordpress.org/tags/skype-online-status "WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Online Status") or go for Live Support via Skype Chat to the Support section on the Skype Online Status Options page after installation. I will be happy to respond :)

= I have installed the plugin, fiddled with the settings, added a widget/shortcode, there is no error message but I see no button! =

This usually happens when the plugin cannot find a Skype ID to work with. You can set a different Skype ID for each widget but be sure to set a Skype ID on your Skype options page so the plugin as at least one to fall back on. If you still see no Skype button, reset all options using the Reset button or the Remove button to remove-uninstall-reinstall and start completely fresh.

= I have installed the plugin and it is working fine, but now there is a ad link below my Skype button. What's with that? =

By default, the plugin displays a link below each Skype button that allows visitors without Skype to download it. This link goes via the plugin creators Skype Affiliate account so with each new Skype install there will be some small revenue for maintenance and support of this plugin. If you object to that, you can either disable the link, change is to a direct link or replace it with your own affiliate link on the Skype Online Status options page.

= I would like to contribute. Is that possible? =

Of cource! What did you have in mind? Monetary funding is always appreciated but if you can help me out in development, that's cool too :) Right now, translation (.mo) files are MORE then welcome! Read [translation instructions http://svn.wp-plugins.org/skype-online-status/trunk/languages/language-support.txt "Skype Online Status translation instructions" (also included in the latest package) for more info.

== Other Notes ==

This plugin has grown a lot since the start but it should be mentioned that it was built upon the neat little plugin Skype Button v2.01 by Anti Veeranna. Many thanks!

= Support =

Post your questions on [WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Legacy Buttons http://wordpress.org/tags/skype-online-status "WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Lecgacy Buttons") or go for Live Support via Skype Chat to the Support section on the Skype Buttons Options page after installation.

= Road Map =

For version 3.5 and beyond :)

- add the modern Skype buttons
- integration with WP user system (skype field on the Profile page, ++)
- More translations! Read [translation instructions http://svn.wp-plugins.org/skype-online-status/trunk/languages/language-support.txt "Skype Legacy Buttons translation instructions" (also included in the latest package) for more info.

= Bugs =

Please report anything you find on [WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Legacy Buttons http://wordpress.org/tags/skype-online-status "WordPress Support &raquo; Skype Legacy Buttons")

When reporting bugs, please describe as carefully as possible and provide information like the version number of the plugin, WordPress and - if relevant - server security settings, PHP and MySQL version. Provide as much related info as you can, so we can reproduce the error... And fix it :) 

= Known issues =

- The javascript provided by Skype that detects whether Skype is installed (client side), does not work properly on Linux. It defaults to displaying a download popup even if Skype is installed on the visitors computer after the Skype button is clicked. Hopefully - but I doubt it - Skype will fix this some day :$
